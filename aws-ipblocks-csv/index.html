		This tool pulls <a

		from the AWS and convert it to CSV, along with other calculated data
		such as the size of each address block. The file can be imported to a
		spreadsheet software of your choice to extract the desired data using
		filters.

	<h3>Where ...</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>IPV</b> is either 4 or 6</li>
		<li><b>SIZE</b> is the number of addresses in the block</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For IPv6 addresses, the CIDR length can be enormous. The tool handles
	them using <code>BigInt</code>, but your spreadsheet software can struggle
	to handle it. It will most likely show the numbers in scientific
	representation.</p>
